## How to modify

The project can be edited using simple text editors such as VSCode/VSCodium or anything you prefer. There is no CSS framework used and the code is commented to help maintenance in the future. The website tries to use progressive enhancement so it will also work if JavaScript is disabled (Tor High Security mode).
